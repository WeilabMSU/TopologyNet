### Usage
See the folder ``Protein-ligand-binding``. The source codes are in the folder ``Protein-ligand-binding/TopBio``. An example protein-ligand complex structure for ``PDB:1A8I`` is provided. See the file ``test_example.py`` for generating the various topological descriptors for the example protein-ligand complex.
